## The project

As part of a business request by Dreamnet SRL, an IoT system that tracks temperature, humidity and CO2 in a room is required to meet a future project to new needs.

Based on first feedback with Professor A. Dewulf (EPHEC), there is also interest in detecting Silicon Oxide from a client with a career.
This will allow the customer to prevent any risk related to the presence of Silicon Oxide at a rate too high.

### Goal

Allow the optimization of the staff environment.
Studies have shown that a room with the right room temperature and good air quality can help focus and improve human health and productivity.

Multiple articles have been published, both from researchers and journalists based on the various studies carried out.
To cite only a few french sources, these two are explaining in summary the value of monitoring and optimizing the environmental data of the workplace:

* <https://www.forbes.fr/management/bonheur-au-travail-le-corps-ce-grand-oublie/>

In addition, it seems that in the professional environment, air pollution is an aggravating factor for respiratory pathologies.
An article correlate the facilitated spread of COVID-19 in this type of environment, was published by Le Soir and is available at the following address:

In the case of the teacher's return, it would be a matter of warning of a possible danger in a risky work environment.
