# Fan Shim for Raspberry Pi

> [Fanshim Python repository from Pimoroni](https://github.com/pimoroni/fanshim-python)

## Installing

* Stable library from PyPi: `sudo pip install fanshim`
* Latest/developement library from GitHub: `./fanshim-firstLaunch.sh` (fanshim pip will also be installed using this way)
  * If you have already installed it from GitHub and want to launch the app back: `./fanshim-launcher.sh`

As the code from Pimoroni install all the necessary things and create a service with our custom parameters implemented in the script, you won't need to relaunch the script at each reboot.

## Description

This part of the project will be used only when a fanshim must be set up on the device.

For example :

* Not really necessary for the Raspberry Pi Zero,
* Interesting for the Raspberry Pi 3 but not necessary,
* Highly recommended for the Raspberry Pi 4.
